# Human-Detection-using-Esp32-and-Edge-Impulse
This project is used to detect human using FOMO machine learning algorithm that is trained using the platform **Edge impulse** and later deployed into esp32-cam board using **Arduino IDE** platform

# INTRODUCTION
**Esp32 cam**
One of the most popular and affordable development boards that already integrates a camera is the ESP32-CAM, which combines an Espressif ESP32-S MCU chip with an ArduCam OV2640 camera.

The ESP32 chip is so powerful that it can even process images. It includes I2C, SPI, UART communications, and PWM and DAC outputs.

Parameters:

Working voltage: 4.75-5.25V

splash: Default 32Mbit

RAM: Internal 520KB + external 8MB PSRAM

Wi-Fi: 802.11b/g/n/e/i

Bluetooth: Bluetooth 4.2BR/EDR and BLE standard

Support interface (2Mbps): UART, SPI, I2C, PWM

Support TF card: maximum support 4G

IO port: 9

Serial port rate: default 115200bps

Spectrum range: 2400 ~2483.5MHz

Antenna form: onboard PCB antenna, gain 2dBi

Image output format: JPEG (only OV2640 support), BMP, GRAYSCALE

Note that this device has not a USB-TTL Serial module integrated, so to upload a code to the ESP32-CAM will be necessary a special adapter as below:

**Installing the ESP32-Cam on Arduino IDE**

Open the preferences window from the Arduino IDE and go to:

Arduino > Preferences

Enter with the below line:

**https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json**

On the field ==> Additional Boards Manager URLs
